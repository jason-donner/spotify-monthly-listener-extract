# üîê Pre-Deployment Security Checklist

## ‚úÖ Security Requirements

### Environment Variables (CRITICAL)
- [ ] **FLASK_SECRET_KEY**: Generate a new 32+ character random string
- [ ] **ADMIN_PASSWORD**: Use a strong, unique password
- [ ] **SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET**: Keep this completely secret
- [ ] **SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI**: Update to your production domain

### Generate Secure Keys
```python
# Run this to generate a secure Flask secret key:
import secrets
print("FLASK_SECRET_KEY=" + secrets.token_hex(32))
```

### Spotify Developer App Setup
1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
2. Create new app or update existing
3. Set redirect URIs:
   - Production: `https://your-domain.com/admin/callback`
   - Local: `http://localhost:5000/admin/callback`
4. Copy Client ID and Client Secret

### Production Environment Variables
```env
# Critical - Change these for production!
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your-64-character-random-hex-string-here
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-very-secure-admin-password
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your-spotify-client-id
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-spotify-client-secret
SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-domain.com/admin/callback

# Optional - Platform specific
