## 🎯 Recommended Starting Points

If you want to start improving immediately, I recommend this order:

1. **Start with logging** (1 day) - Immediate debugging benefits
2. **Add security headers** (0.5 days) - Quick security win
3. **Implement basic caching** (1-2 days) - Immediate performance boost
4. **Begin code restructuring** (2-3 days) - Foundation for everything else

These initial improvements will give you immediate benefits while setting up the foundation for larger improvements.
