# Network Error Resilience Improvements

## Overview
The scraping script has been enhanced to handle network errors and connection issues more gracefully, particularly the `net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` error that occurs when Spotify blocks or rate-limits requests.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in `scrape_artist()`
- **Retry Logic**: Implements automatic retries (up to 3 attempts) for network errors
- **Exponential Backoff**: Increases delay between retries (2s, 3s, 4.5s)
- **Specific Error Detection**: Identifies and handles `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` and other network errors
- **Graceful Degradation**: Returns None values instead of crashing

### 2. Improved Chrome Driver Configuration
- **Network Resilience Settings**: Added multiple Chrome flags for better network handling
- **Increased Timeouts**: Set page load timeout to 30 seconds and implicit wait to 10 seconds
- **Anti-Detection**: Enhanced user agent and disabled automation detection
- **Connection Stability**: Added flags to improve connection reliability

### 3. Enhanced Rate Limiting Protection
- **Progressive Delays**: Minimum 0.5-second wait between requests
- **Extended Pauses**: 3x longer pause every 20 requests
- **Post-Error Delays**: 2x longer wait after any error
- **Adaptive Timing**: Adjusts wait times based on success/failure patterns

### 4. Network Connectivity Testing
- **Pre-flight Check**: Tests connectivity to Spotify before starting scraping
- **Early Error Detection**: Identifies network issues before attempting full scraping
- **User Feedback**: Provides clear error messages for connection problems

### 5. Robust Main Function
- **Global Error Handling**: Catches and handles all types of errors gracefully
- **Partial Results Saving**: Saves progress even if scraping is interrupted
- **Keyboard Interrupt Support**: Handles Ctrl+C gracefully with data preservation
- **Resource Cleanup**: Ensures browser is properly closed even on errors

### 6. Initial Navigation Retry
- **Startup Resilience**: Retries initial Spotify page load up to 3 times
- **Connection Validation**: Ensures browser can connect before starting scraping
- **Clear Error Messages**: Provides specific feedback for startup issues

## Error Scenarios Handled

1. **Network Connection Reset** (`ERR_CONNECTION_RESET`)
2. **DNS Resolution Failures**
3. **Timeout Errors** (page load, element finding)
4. **Rate Limiting** (429 responses, connection blocking)
5. **Browser Crashes** (WebDriver exceptions)
6. **Partial Network Connectivity**
7. **User Interruption** (Ctrl+C)

## Usage Recommendations

### For Public/Automated Hosting:
- Use `--headless` mode for server environments
- Set longer delays with environment variables if needed
- Monitor logs for rate limiting patterns
- Consider running during off-peak hours

### For Development/Testing:
- Run with visual browser first to ensure login works
- Use `--allow-duplicates` for testing without data constraints
- Monitor network usage and adjust delays as needed

### Recovery from Errors:
- The script automatically saves partial results on any interruption
- Failed URLs are retried with longer delays
- Network connectivity is tested before starting
- Clear error messages help diagnose issues

## Files Modified
- `scraping/scrape.py`: Enhanced with all resilience improvements
- `webapp/templates/admin.html`: Fixed status display for "Run Full Scrape Now"
- `webapp/app/routes/admin.py`: Backend supports job tracking for immediate runs

## Testing
The improvements have been tested for:
- ✅ Network connectivity validation
- ✅ Retry logic functionality
- ✅ Error handling and recovery
- ✅ Partial result saving
- ✅ Chrome driver configuration
- ✅ Admin panel integration

The scraping script is now much more resilient to network issues and should handle Spotify's rate limiting and connection blocking more gracefully.
