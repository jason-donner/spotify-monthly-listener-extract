# Security Configuration Migration

## Admin Password Migration (June 25, 2025)

The admin password configuration has been improved for better security and ease of setup.

### What Changed
- **Before**: Admin password was set as an environment variable (`$env:ADMIN_PASSWORD`)
- **After**: Admin password is configured in the `.env` file

### Migration Steps

#### For New Installations
Follow the updated setup in the main README - the admin password is now included in the initial `.env` file configuration.

#### For Existing Installations
1. **Add to your `.env` file** (in the `webapp` directory):
   ```env
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
   ```

2. **Remove manual environment variable** (no longer needed):
   ```powershell
   # This is no longer required
   # $env:ADMIN_PASSWORD = "your_password"
   ```

3. **Restart your application** using `start_app.bat` or `python app.py`

### Benefits of the Change
- **More Secure**: Password stored in file instead of command-line environment
- **Easier Setup**: Single `.env` file contains all configuration
- **Better Documentation**: Clearer, streamlined setup process
- **Consistent**: Follows same pattern as other sensitive config (Spotify credentials)

### Troubleshooting
- **Admin login not working**: Ensure `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is set in your `.env` file
- **"Failed to fetch" errors**: Check that the `.env` file is in the `webapp` directory
- **App won't start**: Verify the `.env` file format and that all required fields are present

### Files Affected
- `webapp/.env` - Add ADMIN_PASSWORD
- `.env.example` - Now includes admin password example
- Documentation - Updated to reflect new process

---

**Note**: This change is fully backward compatible. The application still reads from environment variables, but now loads them from the `.env` file automatically.
